Take note that any GitHub host (such as deroku)
will not be able to handle this code. 
The reason why is because there is a 
huge encrypted database in SQLite that 
makes the bot respond above the max 
tick rate supported by those kind of 
host. The best option would be to host 
it on a different website such as glitch.com 
or replit.com and send an automatic ping 
every laps of 5 minutes to keep it alive.
